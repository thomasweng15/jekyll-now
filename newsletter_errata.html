<p><i>170+ A.I. researchers signed the U.N. letter, out of 3000+ total signatories</i></p>

<p>I wrote that 3000+ researchers signed a petition against autonomous weapons for U.N. policymakers, but only a small fraction of the signatories were A.I. researchers. There were approximately 170 researchers, with the rest being businesspeople, politicians, and other members of society. Still, 170 researchers is a fairly large portion of the A.I. research community.</p>
