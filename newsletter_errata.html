<h2>Issue 1</h2>

I wrote that 3000+ researchers signed a petition against autonomous weapons for U.N. policymakers, but only a small fraction of the signatories were A.I. researchers. There were approximately 170 researchers, and the rest were businesspeople, politicians, and other members of society. Still, 170 researchers is a fairly large portion of the A.I. research community.
