    Hi, I am a PhD student in Robotics working with Prof. <a href="http://davheld.github.io/">Dave Held</a> at the CMU Robotics Institute. My research interests lie in robot learning and human-robot interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    I graduated from Yale in 2015 with bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Economics. As an undergraduate, I assisted Brian Scassellati's research at the <a href="https://scazlab.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Social Robotics Lab</a>, resulting in second-author publications in <a href="http://scazlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/ADMONI_hri16.pdf" target="_blank">HRI 2016</a> and <a href="http://hennyadmoni.com/documents/admoni2016icra.pdf" target="_blank">ICRA 2016</a>. My senior thesis on robotic perception of human gestures was awarded the 2015 Computer Science Research Prize. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Since college, I worked at Microsoft for a few years before returning to research as lab staff at Maya Cakmak's <a href="https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Human-Centered Robotics Lab</a>. Read my CV <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cv" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my spare time, I read/listen to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49071790-thomas" target="_blank">books</a>, practice cooking, participate in athletic events like Tough Mudder with friends, and travel with a moleskine so I can sketch the sights.
