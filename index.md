<h2>Hi, I'm Thomas.</h2>

I'm software engineer at Microsoft. I've worked on the Bing Answers & Widget Experiences team for almost two years, contributing to projects such as the [Bing 2016 Election Answers](http://blogs.bing.com/search?tagname=election%202016&groupid=10), the [Flight Booking Answer](https://www.bing.com/search?q=book%20flight), and Bing at Work.

Download a copy of my resume here: [resume.pdf](../resources/resume.pdf){:target="\_blank"}

Before Microsoft, I double-majored in Computer Science and Economics at Yale University. My senior thesis on real-time robot perception of human nonverbal behavior won the CS departmental prize in research. My lab and I went on to publish in [HRI 2016](http://scazlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/ADMONI_hri16.pdf) and [ICRA 2016](http://hennyadmoni.com/documents/admoni2016icra.pdf).
