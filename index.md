I am an aspiring graduate student seeking admission to robotics PhD programs. My research interests lie in robot task learning and human-robot interaction. I currently conduct research at Maya Cakmak's [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.

I graduated from Yale in 2015 with Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Economics. In college, I assisted Brian Scassellati's research at the [Social Robotics Lab](https://scazlab.yale.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, co-authoring publications in [HRI 2016](http://scazlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/ADMONI_hri16.pdf){:target="\_blank"} and [ICRA 2016](http://hennyadmoni.com/documents/admoni2016icra.pdf){:target="\_blank"}. My senior thesis on robotic perception of human gestures was awarded the Computer Science Research Prize.

I run a [weekly newsletter](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=e17b3f852166c6f688759ade1&id=6763be0722){:target="\_blank"} on developments in robotics research, industry, and policy. I also write posts [on my blog](http://www.thomasweng.com/posts/) from time to time about productivity hacks and what I've been up to.

In my spare time, I listen to [audiobooks](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49071790-thomas){:target="\_blank"} while cooking meals, participate in athletic events like Tough Mudder with friends, and travel with a moleskine so I can sketch the sights.
