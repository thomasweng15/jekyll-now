## About Me
Hi, I am an aspiring researcher in the field of robotics starting my doctoral studies at the CMU Robotics Institute this fall. My research interests lie in robot learning and human-robot interaction.

I graduated from Yale in 2015 with bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Economics. As an undergraduate, I assisted Brian Scassellati's research at the [Social Robotics Lab](https://scazlab.yale.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, resulting in second-author publications in [HRI 2016](http://scazlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/ADMONI_hri16.pdf){:target="\_blank"} and [ICRA 2016](http://hennyadmoni.com/documents/admoni2016icra.pdf){:target="\_blank"}. My senior thesis on robotic perception of human gestures was awarded the 2015 Computer Science Research Prize. 

Since college, I worked at Microsoft for a few years before returning to research as lab staff at Maya Cakmak's [Human-centered Robotics Lab](https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu/). Read my CV <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cv">here</a>.

In my spare time, I read/listen to [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49071790-thomas){:target="\_blank"}, practice cooking, participate in athletic events like Tough Mudder with friends, and travel with a moleskine so I can sketch the sights.
