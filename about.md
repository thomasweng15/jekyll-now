### Who are you?

I'm Thomas, a software engineer at Microsoft. I worked on [Bing's 2016 presidential election experiences](http://blogs.bing.com/search?tagname=election%202016&groupid=10), and currently work on both the [flight booking answer](https://www.bing.com/search?q=book%20flight) as well as a project related to Office 365.

Before joining Microsoft, I graduated in 2015 from Yale with bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Economics. My senior thesis on real-time robot perception of human nonverbal behaviors won the departmental research prize, and my lab and I went on to publish in [HRI 2016](http://hennyadmoni.com/documents/hri16.pdf) and [ICRA 2016](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7487510/).
